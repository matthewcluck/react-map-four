After learning some React for a month and a half, I did a quick React Leaflet project. I fetch a Texas County API and allow the user to pick a county. The county then gets selected on the map. I used GeoJSONs again. Currently there is a bug where the county shape is off. I compressed the file size of the GeoJSON and I think that did it. I do not care to spend time fixing it. Populating the dropdown list alphabetically would also be great, but that is another thing that does not sound fun to sort out. I learned a lot on this project and it was satisfying overcoming some challenges. I am looking forward to improving my React skills.
